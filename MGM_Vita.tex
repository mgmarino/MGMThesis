Michael Gregory Marino has lived many places, but probably not so many so as to make
a nomad jealous.  His life began in San Diego, California, but his family took to the
road after he finished 2\textsuperscript{nd} grade, residing in Spokane and Snohomish, Washington, before 
migrating to Fort Worth, Texas, for the last three years of his high school career.  As his parents
took to the next logical destination (Alaska), he moved north to attend the University of Notre Dame.
His stay in Indiana was interrupted once for a year-long venture to Dublin, Ireland, to 
pursue studies at Trinity College, but he returned to finish his final year at Notre Dame.  
From there, he moved to Seattle, Washington to begin graduate studies in Physics at the University
of Washington.  After completion of these studies, his journey will continue as he proceeds to the
Cluster of Excellence for Fundamental Physics in Munich, Germany, for further physics research.
