\begin{document}

  The following is my plan of action from the general exam.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Develop, test, and deploy data acquisition hardware for the P-PC array 
    \item Develop detector characterization tests and employ these on the array 
    \item Help in the construction/deployment of the module 
    \item Develop analysis tools including PSA algorithms for the P-PC detectors 
    \item Analyze data and generate initial conclusions regarding the physics reach of this R\&D array as well as future arrays
    
  \end{itemize}

  Chapters:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Introduction to Majorana (double-beta decay), introduction to Dark Matter, low-energy physics
    \item Introduction to P-PC, BeGe detectors
    \item Digital readout of BeGe/PPC detectors 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item PPC-II
          \item Description of system
          \item Performance of digital DAQ
              \item Trigger Efficiency
              \item Plots of 
          \item Conclusions  
          \item Slow Pulses (Intro here?)
      \item BeGe/MALBEK, deployment of SIS3302
          \item Trigger efficiency, demonstration of low-energy triggering
          \item Deadtime demonstration 
      \item Demonstration of low-energy threshold
      \item Demonstration of resolution at 2MeV, charge collection, multi-site rejection 
    \end{itemize}

    \item Background reduction from P-PC detectors 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Discuss multi-site rejection, 
                results from digitizer tests (direct comparison between digitizers)
      \item SSTC analysis on 68Ge using PPC-II/BeGe data: construction of likelihood model.
      \item Slow Pulses
    \end{itemize}
    \item Sensitivity of Majorana to low-energy physics 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Listing of low-energy backgrounds
      \item Estimation/Simulation of these backgrounds (focus on only a few here?)
      \item Compare to demonstrated background of CoGeNT? 
      \item Calculation of sensitivity of Majorana for a variety of dark matter models 
      \item Calculation of sensitivity to oscillation signal for Majorana. 
    \end{itemize}

    \item Appendices
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Waveform processing framework (MGDO, OrcaROOT)
      \item Neutrons in MaGe
      \item Generic Surface Sampler
      \item Hardware development of Gretina digitizer/SBC/
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

  TODO:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Characterization of BeGe detectors
    \item Estimation of low-energy background (verification with CoGeNT data?)
    \item Estimation of sensitivity for Majorana
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Simulations, based upon past results, etc.
      \item actual data, can we estimate using CoGeNT data?
      \item data from BeGe detectors?
    \end{itemize} 
    
  \end{itemize}
