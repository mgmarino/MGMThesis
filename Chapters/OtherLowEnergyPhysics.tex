\chapter{Other low-energy physics with P-type point contact detectors}

In this section, we basically discuss two things: Heavy non-relativistic axions, the signal, and the exclusion limit as calculated with the data from the previous chapter.

Also, making some reasonable assumptions about Majorana, we make some estimates as to the sensitivity of the Majorana experiment to WIMP dark matter and axion dark matter (via the axioelectric effect).  

		
	\section{Other dark matter candidates: keV-scale bosons}
	\label{sec:CalcLimitsOnHeavyAxions}		

	The lack of understanding as to how a dark matter particle couples with normal matter described by the Standard Model has motivated wide theoretical investigation resulting in a large number of candidate particles in addition to WIMPs.  Additionally, results from the NaI-based DAMA experiment~\cite{Bernabei:2005ca} have demonstrated a clear annual modulation signal which could be interpreted as arising from the earth's movement through a galactic cloud of dark matter particles.  Because other experiments sensitive to WIMP interactions have failed to reproduce this result, the possibility remains that some non-WIMP-like process could underly the cause.  However, the results of the DAMA experiment are not the sole motivation for studying dark matter candidates beyond WIMPs.  Whereas most dark matter experiments focus their sensitivity on looking for one type of signal (i.e.~a nuclear recoil from a WIMP interaction), it is still essential to consider other possibilities.  
	
	Pospelov et al.~have completed a study~\cite{Pospelov:2008jk} looking at keV-massive bosons as dark matter candidates.  In particular, they outline the expected interactions and rates for scalar, pseudoscalar, and vector bosons incident upon modern detectors.  In general, Pospelov et al.~avoid in-depth discussions regarding theoretical motivation of each bosonic type, but it is possible to interpret a pseudoscalar as equivalent to an axion (or axionlike) particle responsible for preserving CP in QCD (see, e.g.~\cite{Amsler20081}).  Therefore other work deriving axion processes or limits on such processes remains relevant in this case.  As such, the following sections consider the coupling of a pseudoscalar to electrons in a detector and therefore refer to this process as an `axioelectric' effect and the originating particle as an `axion.'  

	\subsection{Axioelectric signal}
	\label{sec:CalcLimitsOnHeavyAxionSignal}		

	The signal for a non-relativistic axion interacting via the axioelectric effect has been derived in~\cite{Pospelov:2008jk}.  This particular inelastic interaction involves the deposition of the \emph{complete} energy of the axion which in the non-relativistic case is essentially equal to the mass of the particle.  Since the excitation of the electron via the axioelectric effect is similar to the process mediated by a photon in the photoelectric effect, the signal is a delta function centered at the mass of the axion, $m_{a}$.  Convolved with the detector resolution, the signal would appear gaussian with width exactly that of a gamma or x-ray of energy equivalent to $m_{a}$.  The rate of this interaction has been estimated in~\cite{Pospelov:2008jk} as:
	
		\begin{equation}
			R \left[ kg^{-1} day^{-1} \right]\simeq \frac{1.2\times 10^{19}}{A} \gaa^{2} m_a \sigma_{photo}
			\label{eqn:AxioelectricRate}
		\end{equation}

where $A$ is the atomic mass, $m_{a}$ is the mass of the axion in keV, $\sigma_{photo}$ is the measured photoelectric cross section in barns, and $g_{a\bar{e}e}$ is the dimensionless coupling constant.  In the derivation of this result, the value of the density of the dark matter $\rho_{D}$ = 0.3~GeV cm$^{-3}$ was used.  Also, Pospelov et al.~noted that this interaction rate should not exhibit an annual modulation from the earth's orbital velocity and therefore no time dependence was included in the equation.  The rate calculated for a germanium detector ($A=72.96$) with a chosen coupling constant, $\gaa = 10^{-11}$, is given in Figure~\ref{fig:HeavyAxionSignalRate}.  The rate calculation used well-known cross sections obtained from the NIST FFAST database located online~\cite{chantler:597}.  The sharp feature in the plot around $m_{a}\sim1.3$~keV arises from the L-line resonance at this energy.  Other sharp features similarly relate to the energy levels of the electrons in a germanium atom.  

The low noise of PPC detectors yields excellent sensitivity to non-relativistic axions with masses $\leq10$~keV due their sharp resolution at low energies.  This enhanced performance is especially clear when considering the capabilities of NaI detectors used in the DAMA experiment.  A comparison of an axioelectric signal at a given $\gaa$ is provided in Figure~\ref{fig:ResCompare} for characteristic resolutions of NaI and germanium detectors.  In this plot, it is clear that the improved resolution of the germanium detector allows less smearing of the signal, forcing more counts into a narrower peak.  The enhanced resolution enables superior distinction of the signal in the presence of background.

	\subsection{Limits on the axioelectric effect}
	\label{sec:CalcLimitsOnHeavyAxionLimits}		
		
	Limits were calculated using the profile-likelihood method described in Section~\ref{sec:LimitsML}.  Fits were performed on the complete number of data sets described in Chapter~\ref{chap:AnalysisBeGe}, with a total livetime of 150.6~days.  All data sets yielded similar results and so one data set was chosen with 95\% rise-time acceptance cuts and microphonics cuts applied.  As outlined before, assumptions about the source of slow-rise-time events reduced the fiducial mass to 0.33~kg (see Section~\ref{sec:BeGeLowEnergyFeatures}).  Additionally, results with unbinned and binned maximum-likelihood fits were consistent and so the former was used for the final result.  The limit calculation followed the same procedure as a peak search in the data and is outlined as follows:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Define the gaussian signal $f_{axion}$: 
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Choose mass $m_{a}$ of the axion defining $\mu$ of gaussian
				\item Determine $\sigma$ at $E = m_{a}$ using resolution in Equation~\ref{eqn:SigmaEqn}.
			\end{itemize}
			\item Fit to the function $B + N_{axion} f_{axion}$ where $B$ is the background defined in Section~\ref{sec:LimitsDataAndModel} and determine the profile likelihood $\plln$.
			\item Determine the 90\% upper limit on $N_{axion}$ using $\plln$.
			\item Repeat for other values of $m_{a}$
		\end{itemize}		
	
	During the fits, the $\mu$ and $\sigma$ of the gaussian signal, $f_{axion}$, were kept fixed and only the amplitude, $N_{axion}$ was kept as a free parameter of the signal.  For the background, the behavior of the parameters was the same as during WIMP exclusion fits (see Section~\ref{sec:LimitsDataAndModel}) and the relative amplitude of the \gersixeight~and\znsixfive~L-lines was kept fixed as described in Section~\ref{sec:LimitsConstrained}.  Fixing this relative amplitude served to minimize the impact of the L-lines in the exclusion fits since a signal centered at 1.1 and 1.3~keV would look exactly like the L-capture lines.  The difficulties seen while determining limits on low-mass WIMPs did not appear in these calculations because the signal (gaussian centered at $m_{a}$) was not similar to the background except for the case of the L-lines.  The value of the axion mass was scanned from 0.1~keV to 7.8~keV in steps of 0.2~keV using both high- and low-gain channels: high-gain channel, $0.1\to2.9$~keV; low-gain channel, $3\to7.8$~keV.  The axion mass was allowed to vary below threshold (0.5~keV) because the finite resolution of the detector would allow portions of the expected gaussian signal to be detected above threshold.  An example of an exclusion fit in the high-gain channel is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ExampleHeavyAxionFit} for $m_{a}=3$~keV.  

		\begin{figure}
			\centering
			\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{AxioelectricFitExample}
			\caption[Example of an excluded non-relativistic axioelectric signal at $m_{a}=3$~keV at

			The components of the fits are split: red solid, L-Lines; red dotted, flat plus exponential
			background; blue dashed, excluded axioelectric signal.}
			\label{fig:ExampleHeavyAxionFit}
		\end{figure}
			
	The 90\% CL excluded rate in counts/kg/day, $R_{axion}(m_{a})$, was determined from $N_{axion}(m_{a})$ and from this value the upper limit of $\gaa$ could be determined.  The exclusion calculated from this result is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:HeavyAxionLimits} along with a comparison to other results, including previous results of the CoGeNT collaboration~\cite{Aalseth:2008aa}, the CDMS collaboration~\cite{Ahmed2009}, and an acceptance region from the DAMA collaboration~\cite{Bernabei:2005ca}.  As noted in both references~\cite{Collar:2009sp,Pospelov:2008jk}, the limit calculation performed in~\cite{Bernabei:2005ca} did not correctly treat the leading term in Hamiltonian producing instead a reduced rate for a given $\gaa$ around 3 orders of magnitude lower.  An estimation of the corrected result from DAMA as outlined in~\cite{Collar:2009sp} appears in Figure~\ref{fig:HeavyAxionLimits}.  A comparison to limits derived from both solar neutrinos~\cite{Gondolo09} and globular clusters~\cite{Raffelt95} is included as well.  The limits obtained from astronomical observation arise from determining how much `hidden energy' may be carried off by axions from the solar core (in the case of solar neutrinos) and similarly from the cooling observed in the evolution of red-giant stars in globular clusters.  All direct measurements provide stronger limits than those from solar neutrinos, but the mass-independent limits from globular cluster stars still exceed all others.  
			
	Pospelov et al.~noted the axioelectric process should be to first order invariant to the velocity of the incoming dark matter particle and so would not generate an appreciable annual modulation.  This could disallow any interpretation of the DAMA annual modulation as due to an axioelectric interaction.  Collar et al.~point out the possibility of recovering the annual modulation by considering the axioelectric interaction rate as not arising from changes in incident dark matter velocity but rather from the number densities of the particles~\cite{Collar:2009sp}.  Since the comparison between astronomical limits and direct detection methods will depend strongly on choices of models and their parameters, it is still important to explore the space disallowed by globular cluster limits.

	\subsection{Conclusions and Discussion}
	\label{sec:DiscOnHeavyAxionLimits}	

	Note what we've done here, in particular looking at an axioelectric signal in data.  Also note that this is one very small detector that's comparable to a large array.  Talk about how this could be better with MJ and how the limits from astrophysical observations still need to be checked.  
	
	The results from this section underscore and emphasize the physics reach of PPC detectors.  In particular, a limited amount of data from a small `table-top' detector (mass exposure $\sim50$~kg-days yielded results comparable to and in some cases better than results from CDMS which had more than a factor of 5 greater exposure time (443.2~kg-days).  Though limits derived from astronomical observations still exceed those from direct detection experiments, it remains important to verify these limits and if possible better them with larger exposure times and smaller backgrounds.  The need to explore dark matter candidates beyond those offered by WIMP theories remains evident and the only method to ensure experimental sensitivity to rare events with an \emph{a priori} unknown signature is to reduce known backgrounds through appropriate shielding and detector component radiopurity.  The \MJ~experiment seeks to do this to search for $\nonubb$, but the same efforts to reduce backgrounds in the double-beta decay signal region ($\sim2$~MeV) should benefit searches for dark matter in low-energy regions.  The following sections discuss and calculate the sensitivity of the \MJ~\minmod~to such searches.
							
	\section{Sensitivity of the \MJ~\minmod~to dark matter signals}
	\label{sec:MJSensitivity}
	
	Since a framework was established to determine exclusion limits for low-mass WIMPs and for the axioelectric coupling constant, it is simple to apply this same framework to determine the sensitivities of the \MJ~\minmod~to various dark matter signals.  The ultra-clean composition of the \minmod~should provide an excellent detector for searching for dark matter without relying upon significant background reduction cuts (e.g.~discriminating between nuclear and electron recoils).  Calculating the sensitivity of the experiment involves making some assumptions of the background at low energies and of the makeup of the experiment.  A discussion about the estimation of the background is given in the following in Section~\ref{sec:MJLowEnergyBackgroundModel}.  The general prescription for calculating the sensitivity is as follows:
	
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Generate a background model, including an expected rate of background
			\item Simulate a spectrum according to the background model
			\item Fit to the simulated spectrum the background model plus a signal model (e.g.~WIMP or axioelectric spectrum)
			\item Calculate the upper limit on the amplitude of the signal at 90\% CL.
			\item Repeat a large number of times to generate an ensemble of limits.
		\end{itemize}	
From the generated ensemble of limits, the 90\% CL value which was above 99\% of the limits was chosen.  Details of the \MJ~\minmod are given in Chapter~\ref{chap:Majorana}.  For these purposes, we have conservatively assumed that the \MJ~\minmod~will be composed of 20~kg of material and that it will run to accumulate between 1 and 5~years of livetime.  
	
		\subsection{Low-energy background model}
		\label{sec:MJLowEnergyBackgroundModel}
		
The estimation of background generally comes from verified simulations and from extrapolations from previous experiments.  In this work, the background is estimated by assuming it arises from two main sources: (1) a continuum from higher energy processes, and (2) counts from the beta decay of cosmogenically-produced tritium in the detector.  A simulation to estimate (1) is wrought with challenge since a large number of contributions can affect the result.  However, it is possible to use previous results from other germanium-based experiments to produce an estimate of this background.  The IGEX experiment measured a flat background rate of $\sim0.1$~counts/keV/kg/day in this low energy region ($4\to10$~keV)~\cite{Ira01}.    The \MJ~\minmod~plans to reduce background above 200~keV by a factor of 100~\cite{MajoranaWhitePaper} and so it is reasonable to expect the flat background at low energies will follow this same reduction to be roughly 0.001~counts/keV/kg/day.  This background was assumed to not vary in time as well so that it was flat in both time and energy.

The estimate of a background to tritium involves understanding the activation rate of tritium for germanium at the surface of the earth.  This activation rate has been estimated to be $\lesssim200$~\hthree~atoms per kilogram of Ge per day for natural germanium at the surface of the earth, and almost a factor of 2 less for germanium with enriched \gersevensix~content~\cite{Avi92}.  The exposure is determined by the time of manufacture beginning with the pulling of the germanium crystal since the tritium content is `reset' at this point.  For example, if the entire process from crystal pulling to detector development and then final deployment (or storage) underground takes 15~days, then this integrated time is the the total tritium activation period for the detector.  For a kilogram natural-germanium detector created over such a time scale, we would expect there to be $15\times200\sim3000$ atoms of \hthree~within the detector.  Given the slow time of decay of \hthree~(12.32~years), it is critical to minimize the time above ground and certainly necessary to avoid any time at high altitudes, e.g.~storage or transport via airplane.  In this simple background model, two optimistic exposure times are chosen -- 15 and 30~days -- and it is assumed that the detectors begin taking data immediately after arriving underground.  In practice, this assumption is justified due to the long decay time of tritium since the detector will not significantly cool down during a period of time underground much shorter than the lifetime.  The average rates due to these exposures once underground are then roughly 0.03 and 0.06~counts/keV/kg/day for 15 and 30~days, respectively.  The pdf of the tritium decay function was constructed in both time and energy to be:

		\begin{equation}
			f_{^{3}\text{H}}\left(E, t\right)  =  g_{^{3}\text{H}}\left(E\right) \times h_{^{3}\text{H}}\left(t\right) 
		\end{equation}
		with
		\begin{eqnarray}
		g_{^{3}\text{H}}\left(E\right) & = & \sqrt{(E + M_e)^2 - M_e^2} \left(
			E + M_e \right) \left( Q_{^3\text{H}} - E \right)^2 \\
h_{^{3}\text{H}}\left(t\right) & = & e^{-t/\tau_{^3\text{H}}}
		\end{eqnarray}
		and $Q_{^3\text{H}}=18.6$~keV, $M_{e}=511$~keV, and $\tau_{^3\text{H}} = 12.32 / \log(2)$~years.
		
	The background from neutrons has been estimated previously for the IGEX experiment~\cite{Carmona2004523} located at the Canfranc underground laboratory.  This reference considered both neutrons from cosmic-ray muons interacting in the rock as well as neutrons arising from spontaneous fission and ($\alpha$, n) reactions.  Estimates from this (see Figure~7 and Tables 2,3 in\cite{Carmona2004523}, Figure~7 is reproduced here in Figure~\ref{fig:IGEXNeutrons}) suggested that contributions to IGEX from both sources should be below 0.01~counts/keV/kg/day down to 0~keV.  Additionally, it was demonstrated that neutrons from rock radioactivity could be effectively eliminated with additional shielding.  Though the \MJ~\minmod~will have a different geometry to that of the IGEX experiment, it is expected that these numbers are a conservative upper limit due to the fact that the \minmod~will be in a deeper location (DUSEL vs.~Canfranc).  From these conclusions and because the background from \hthree~should at least initially dominate the \minmod, any background contribution from neutrons was omitted from the background model.

				neutron moderator configurations for the IGEX experiment, and the lines are exponential fits to guide the eye.
				A conservative extrapolation suggests that all of these spectra should be well below 0.01~counts/keV/kg/day at
				0~keV and is much less than 0.001~counts/keV/kg/day above 10~keV.}
				\label{fig:IGEXNeutrons}
			\end{figure}
	
	In general, the detector response must be convolved with the spectrum to get a realistic shape.  However, since point-contact detectors have such excellent energy resolution ($\sigma\sim70$~eV), the response has limited effect on the spectra.  Therefore, no correction for finite resolution was taken into account.  

		\subsection{Sensitivity Fitting}
		\label{sec:MJSensitivityFitting}
	
	The fitting procedure used binned maximum likelihood instead of an unbinned fit to reduce the time required in estimating an upper limit for each toy data model.  Three parameters affecting the fits were varied: tritium exposure time, threshold, and exposure time of the \minmod.  Each of these parameters could take two different values (see Table~\ref{tab:SensFitValues}) so that for each signal eight different sets of fits were done.  The data sets and fitting pdfs were both fully two-dimensional in energy and time and were fit over a range from threshold to 20~keV.  The binning was chosen as follows: 256~bins for energy and 16~bins for time.  For each of the eight set of fits for a signal, an ensemble of upper limits with a population $\gtrsim1500$\footnote{ An exact population number was not specified for the ensembles to maximize the efficiency of the calculation.  It was more efficient to specify the \emph{time} for the calculation to run, than for to define a specific number of iterations.} was generated on the Athena cluster at the University of Washington~\cite{Athena}.  The final sensitivity calculations outlined in the following sections took roughly 700 hours of real-time or 221~cpu-days.

		\subsection{Sensitivity to WIMPs}
		\label{sec:MJSensitivityToWIMP}
		
	The sensitivity calculations for WIMPs employed the 2-dimensional (time, energy) signal described in the previous chapter and more details can be found in Section~\ref{sec:CalcLimitsOnWIMPSignal}.  The equivalent values for all constants in the WIMP signal were used as previously noted.  The fits proceeded as outlined in the previous section (Section~\ref{sec:MJSensitivityFitting}).  The shape of the WIMP signal was parameterized solely by the mass of the WIMP, $M_{W}$, and so fits were performed with different values of this parameter on a variable grid (in GeV) of spacing given in $\Delta M_{W}$: 2.9; 3; 3.5; $4\to10, \Delta M_{W} = 1$; $12\to24, \Delta M_{W} = 2$; $30\to100, \Delta M_{W} = 10$; $100\to1000, \Delta M_{W} = 100$.  An example sensitivity fit to a WIMP signal at $M_{W}=10$~GeV is given in Figure~\ref{fig:MJSensitivityToWIMPExample}.  In this particular example, the threshold was 0.3~keV, \hthree~exposure time was 15~days, and the total exposure time was 1~year.  It is clear that the amplitude of the excluded signal is very small and perhaps smaller than one might expect given the average count rate dominated by the \hthree~decay.  However, the shape of a WIMP signal is significantly different from that of a tritium beta spectrum making a stronger exclusion possible because the shape of the spectra are taken into account.  A simple integration analysis looking solely at counts in a defined energy window would fail to produce the same limits.

				 signal (blue dashed) and flat background (red dotted).  The beta spectum from \hthree~dominates the fit.}
				\label{fig:MJSensitivityToWIMPExample}
			\end{figure}
	
	The final results of the sensitivity calculation are presented in Figure~\ref{fig:MJSensitivityToWIMP}.  This figure includes results from the eight different sets of fits with the modification of the exposure times and the threshold.  The factor of 2 increase in exposure time doesn't have a significant impact other than softening the exclusion limits as the WIMP mass increases.  The threshold has a fairly significant impact below 10.5~GeV yielding better exclusions for WIMP masses below that value and pushing the exclusion region diagonally left and down in the plot.  This is certainly due to the sharp reduction of the tritium spectrum at low energies and to the sharp turn on of the exponential-like WIMP spectrum.  As expected, the reduced threshold of 0.3~keV enables limits to be made down to $M_{W}=3.5$~GeV.

	It is instructive to compare the estimated sensitivity of the \minmod~to that of other WIMP dark matter experiments.  The \MJ~experiment is distinct from most dark matter experiments since, for one, it is not primarily seeking to detect dark matter, but also because it will not rely upon any significant background reduction technique to enhance its sensitivity to WIMP-induced nuclear recoils.  That is, the \MJ~experiment will not have the ability to distinguish between nuclear and electron recoils.  Despite this, it can still be competitive because it can access parameter space unreachable by other experiments with higher thresholds.  A comparison of the sensitivity of the \MJ~\minmod~(assuming 0.3~keV threshold, 15~day tritium exposure, and 100~kg-yr exposure) to two characteristic dark matter experiments is given in Figure~\ref{fig:MJSensitivityToWIMPCompare}.  These two experiments include Phase A of SuperCDMS~\cite{Akerib2006411} and the 300~kg LUX experiment~\cite{LUX300}.  The former is a proposed Ge-based dual-mode bolometer and ionization detector, the latter a proposed liquid-Xe-based detector that would read out both scintillation light and ionization.  The dual-mode nature of these detectors gives them the ability to tag nuclear recoils and reject the electron recoils which dominate the background spectrum.  Whereas it is obvious that the reach of these experiments in the higher-WIMP-mass range ($>10.5$~GeV) far exceeds that of the \MJ~\minmod, the low-energy threshold of the \minmod~enables it to push well into the lower-WIMP-mass region.

		\subsection{Sensitivity to axioelectric effect}
		\label{sec:MJSensitivityToAxions}
		
	The sensitivity calculations for the axioelectric effect employed the signal model outlined earlier in Section~\ref{sec:CalcLimitsOnHeavyAxionSignal}.  For simplicity and because it is not expected that the rate of interaction does not vary significantly in time~\cite{Pospelov:2008jk}, this model was only 1-dimensional in energy.  The mass of the axion, $m_{a}$, was chosen on a variable grid (in keV) with spacing given in $\Delta m_{a}$: $0.1\to1, \Delta m_{a} = 0.1$; $1\to9, \Delta m_{a} = 0.2$.  An example sensitivity fit to an axioelectric signal centered at $m_{a}=5$~keV is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:MJSensitivityToAxionExample}.  In this example fit, a threshold of 0.3~keV and and a tritium exposure time of 15 days is assumed.  As before, components of the fit appear separately for comparison.

	The sensitivity for the \MJ~\minmod~to the axioelectric effect is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:MJSensitivityToAxion}.  All of the exclusion plots have similar characteristics, including a sharp drop at $m_{a}=1.3$~keV and a rise at low $m_{a}$.  The former arises from the corresponding feature in the rate (Figure~\ref{fig:HeavyAxionSignalRate}) due to the L-capture line resonance.  The latter comes from the reduction in threshold and the `leakage' of signal from lower energies pushed above threshold due to the finite energy resolution of the detector.  Larger tritium exposure time softens the sensitivity, but not significantly because $\gaa$ appears squared in the rate equation (Equation~\ref{eqn:AxioelectricRate}).  Also, as expected at higher $m_{a}$ the sensitivity has no dependence on the threshold.

	A comparison plot to other experiments has not been generated because no experiments have published sensitivities to the axioelectric effect.  However, since most other dark matter experiments rely upon background reduction through electron and nuclear recoil discrimination, it is possible that these experiments will not have a significant sensitivity to an axioelectric signal because the process appears as an electron recoil event.  To help compare with results presented before in Figure~\ref{fig:HeavyAxionLimits}, Figure~\ref{fig:MJSensitivityToHeavyAxionsCompare} is shown including exclusion limits from solar neutrinos~\cite{Gondolo09} and globular clusters~\cite{Raffelt95}.  It is interesting to note that the \MJ~experiment will demonstrate a better sensitivity to $\gaa$ than limits derived from astronomical observation in the limited $m_{a}$ mass range from $0.2\to5$~keV.  This will provide an important verification of the limits from globular clusters.

	\section{Conclusions and Discussion}
	\label{sec:OtherLowEnergyConclusions}	
	
	This will be one of the more final discussions, but I can add to it later.  For now, focus on how these detectors can access different styles of dark matter because of their excellent energy resolution and threshold.
