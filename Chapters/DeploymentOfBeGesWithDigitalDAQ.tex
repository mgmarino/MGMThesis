\label{chap:DeploymentPPC2Soudan}
	\section{Introduction}
	\label{sec:DeploymentPPC2SoudanIntro}
			
		A \ppc~detector (henceforth referred to as \ppc2) was procured by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in January 2008 to be used in studies aimed at more clearly understanding the detector technology~\cite{Orr2007}.  Initial tests took place in the laboratory, focusing on basic operation and pulse-shape analysis techniques relevant for background reduction in the $\nonubb$ region-of-interest and for dark matter searches~\cite{Orr2008}.  In November 2008, \ppc2 was deployed underground at Soudan Underground Laboratory at a depth of 2100~m.w.e.  The goals of this deployment were two-fold: (1) demonstrate the reliability and operation of a scaled-down \MJ-like digital DAQ system in an underground environment, and (2) investigate the possibility of obtaining dark matter exclusion data.  The latter goal was uncertain due to the lack of knowledge of the intrinsic backgrounds of the detector and its cryostat.  
		%The development of the DAQ system used in this deployment is outlined in Chapter~\ref{chap:DAQDevel}
		
		Underground, the detector was placed inside 8~inches of Pb with a 2-inch inner shield composed of OFHC Cu.  This shield was surrounded by a sealed radon-exclusion box over-pressurized with nitrogen gas from LN boil-off to limit the introduction of Rn gas.  Borated-polyethylene planks were built up surrounding the outer lead for moderation of neutrons generated by interactions of cosmic-ray muons in the rock walls.  An engineering drawing of the shield can be seen %in Figure~\ref{fig:PPC2OnlyShield} and 
with all components in Figure~\ref{fig:PPC2Shield}.  Relevant characteristics of the crystal are given in Table~\ref{tab:PPC2Characteristics}.

	\section{Description of DAQ system}
	\label{sec:DeploymentPPC2SoudanDAQSystem}
	
	The DAQ system was designed as a single-channel prototype for the
\MJ~\minmod.  Additionally, a significant amount of effort was put in to ensure
that the setup was remotely configurable to enable the modification of
experimental parameters by experimenters at the University of Washington and
PNNL.  Signals from the detector were read out using a Gretina Mark IV
digitizer designed by the GRETA collaboration~\cite{Anderson:2009p1293}.  This
VME64x-based ADC digitized 10 independent channels at 100~Ms/s with a
resolution of 14 bits.  The card was read out on the VME backplane using a
Concurrent Technologies VX 407/042 single-board computer controlled via gigabit
ethernet by the ORCA DAQ and slow controls software~\cite{ORCA} running on an
Apple Mac Mini computer.  For more details regarding the ORCA DAQ software and
the development of its components relevant to this hardware configuration,
please see Appendix~\ref{app:ORCASoftwareChapter}.  Also, additional details
regarding the development and investigation of this DAQ system are given in
Appendix~\ref{chap:DAQDevel}. The high voltage on \ppc2 was applied with a
Canberra LYNX system which allowed for remote powering control of the
detector bias.  The Liquid Nitrogen (LN) dewar was filled manually by the
laboratory staff so no explicit tag was set in the data stream during these
fills.  Techniques to identify and cut out these events are discussed in
Section~\ref{sec:DeploymentPPC2SoudanAnalysisCuts}.
	    
	As with many low-noise designs, the \ppc2 preamp employed a pulse-reset circuit to avoid the Johnson noise associated with a feedback resistor.  The preamp had 3~outputs: 2~signal outputs and 1~inhibit output which would fire when the reset circuitry of the preamp was active.  Additionally, there was a test input for pulser signals used in electronic testing.  The 2~signal outputs were AC-coupled to remove their DC components using independent capacitors of $\sim500$~nF to yield a roughly 50~$\mu$s decay time of the preamp pulses.  One of these channels was input directly into the digitizer; the other was routed through a Phillips Scientific 777 fast amplifier (DC$\to$200~MHz bandwidth) with roughly $10\times$ gain to obtain better resolution near threshold from $0.5\to80$~keV.  The signal was split after the 777, with one output being input into a digitizer channel in the Gretina card and the other routed through a conventional spectroscopy amplifier (Ortec 667) to generate the trigger for the high-gain channel.  Figure~\ref{fig:PPC2DAQSetup} provides a simplified visualization of the DAQ setup including signal paths.  See Section~\ref{sec:DeploymentPPC2SoudanTriggerDesign} for more details regarding the high-gain trigger and its development.  The inhibit output was sent directly into the Gretina digitizer card to record the timing information of the reset circuitry.
	
	The test input of the preamp was used for pulser signals to measure the efficiency of the trigger.  The pulser used was an Agilent 33220A waveform generator controlled via ethernet by ORCA running on the Mac mini.  The pulser output passed through 2~computer-controlled attenuators (HP 8494/5G, 0$\to$4~GHz bandwidth) providing up to 71~dB of attenuation in increments of 1~dB.  These attenuators were actuated using a constructed driver box controlled with an InterPak 408 digital I/O card on the VME bus.  For more details on the pulser test setup, see Section~\ref{sec:DeploymentPPC2SoudanTriggerDesign}.  A synchronization pulse from the Agilent was input into a digitizer channel for timing information.  The pulser was also used during counting runs, inputting a signal of low amplitude ($\sim$2.5~keV) into the DAQ system at low rate ($\sim1$~Hz) to measure any deviations in the electronics over time.
		     
	Finally, an input channel on the Gretina digitizer was designated as an input for a muon veto that was installed after initial deployment of the DAQ system.  However, the veto was unused in the analysis and so details about its operation are omitted.  A summary of the input channels on the Gretina card including the type of data saved for each is given in Table~\ref{tab:PPC2DAQChannelInfo}.  
%A schematic of the DAQ setup is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:PPC2DAQSetup}.  
The DAQ system was fully deployed underground at the beginning of April 2009.

	\section{Analysis and results}
	\label{sec:DeploymentPPC2SoudanAnalysis}
	
	After a few months of commissioning and calibration tests, counting runs were begun on 3 May 2009.  Runs were cycled every hour, and data were automatically synchronized with a server at the University of Washington.  On 10 June 2009, automatic trigger efficiency tests were begun in between runs to monitor the stability of the trigger over time.  Counting runs ended on 24 July 2009, yielding a total live-time of 70.4 days.  A \couchdb~database~\cite{CouchDB} was used to store both metadata (e.g.~timing, configuration, file names, etc.) as well as analysis parameters (e.g.~average baseline, trigger efficiency, measured electronic noise) from each run.  This database was also used to facilitate the analysis chain described in the following section.    

		\subsection{Data processing}
		\label{sec:DeploymentPPC2DataProcessing}	
	
	All data were handled in a tiered reduction scheme.  The analysis process was automated and made significant use of the ROOT analysis framework~\cite{Bru97} as well as waveform analysis tools (MGDO, see Appendix~\ref{app:MGDO} for more information) developed for the \MJ~experiment.  An outline of the tiered data-flow process is given:
		\begin{description}\itemsep2pt
			\item[Tier 0:]  Raw binary data -- from the ORCA DAQ system
			\item[Tier 1:]  ROOTified data -- raw data converted to MGDO objects and stored in ROOT TFiles
			\item[Tier 2:]  Waveform processed data -- extraction of waveform characteristics using MGDO Transforms
			\item[Tier 3:]  Reduced data and split into sub-components (folders) according to different channels
		\end{description}	
		
	This process was tracked using a \couchdb~database.  The Tier~$0\to1$ conversion process took the raw binary data and converted it into MGDO \cpp~objects which could then be serialized to disk in ROOT TFiles.  The Tier~$1\to2$ processing calculated several parameters from the waveform data, including baseline, extrema (maximum and minimum), and rise-time and determined the amplitude of the waveform using a trapezoidal filter\footnote{The Gretina digitizer included an on-board trapezoidal filter, but it was chosen to use an offline filter for greater flexibility.}~\cite{Jor94}.  More information regarding the baseline and rise-time calculations are given in Sections~\ref{sec:DeploymentPPC2SoudanAnalysisCuts} and~\ref{sec:DeploymentPPC2SoudanAnalysisRisetime}.  Additionally, at this stage coincidences between events in different channels were calculated using the timing information from the digitizer card, defining events within $1~\mu$s of each other as concurrent.   Finally, the Tier~$2\to3$ processing reduced the data size, removing noise events (i.e.~events well below energy threshold) and splitting the two signal channels 0 and 8 into separate file groups.  The Tier~3 files were used directly in analysis and made available to others in the \MJ~collaboration through a cloud-based file system (Dropbox\footnote{See the Dropbox website: \url{https://www.dropbox.com} for more information.}).
	
		\subsection{Initial calibration}
		\label{sec:DeploymentPPC2SoudanAnalysisCalibration}    
			
	The system was initially calibrated with a $^{133}$Ba source using peaks detailed in Table~\ref{tab:Ba133Peaks}.  The high- and low-gain channels were calibrated independently and spectra for each channel are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:PPC2Calibration}.  The two channels exhibited an energy range up to $\sim100$~keV and $\sim 2.6$~MeV, respectively, though the range of the low-gain channel is discussed in more detail in Section~\ref{sec:DeploymentPPC2SoudanAnalysisEnergySpectra} .  These initial calibrations were used for commissioning tests such as trigger efficiency and electronic noise measurements and were later refined using prominent peaks from backgrounds e.g.~in the U and Th chains, $^{40}$K, and x-ray lines from \gersixeight~and \znsixfive~electron capture decays (see Section~\ref{sec:DeploymentPPC2SoudanAnalysisEnergySpectra}).  During the counting runs, regular calibration runs were not made; instead we monitored the behavior of the detector using an injected pulser.

		\subsection{Detector parameters vs.~time}	
		\label{sec:PPC2DetParsVsTime}
		
	Several parameters of the system were tracked over time, including the trigger efficiency and the electronic noise of the system.  The former was tested by performing efficiency tests every hour in between run cycles; the latter by looking at the recorded data of the input pulser pulses (1~Hz) versus time.  Several other parameters, including the baseline of the waveforms and the number of events in a certain energy ranges, were tracked as well: these results are presented in Section~\ref{sec:DeploymentPPC2SoudanAnalysisCuts}.  In addition to these specific parameters being tracked, the rates of each channel were tracked.  While tracking these rates, it was determined that the reset rate of the preamp increased towards the end of an LN fill cycle.  Higher values of inhibit rate (lower baseline values) occurred as LN in the dewar boiled off, with sharp returns when the dewar was refilled.  The interpretation of this was that as the level of LN in the dewar fell, the temperature of the front-end detector electronics (and possibly the crystal) would increase which would increase the detector leakage current.  An increase in leakage current would cause the preamp to reset more often to clear the charge more quickly accumulating on the feedback capacitor.  It was not determined precisely what caused this temperature sensitivity; however, it was likely due to insufficient thermal coupling between the detector and the liquid nitrogen.  During installation of the detector within the Pb shield, an extension had to be added to the dewar end of the cold finger.  It is possible that this extension didn't properly thermally couple to the cold finger and thus didn't cool the detector and/or the internal electronics as effectively.  The change of the reset rate over time had implications for other parameters as discussed in the following sections.  A summary of comparisons between detector parameters is shown later in the section in Figure~\ref{fig:PPC2AllPlotCompare}.  In this figure, LN fills occurred around runs~1590, 1665, and 1750.  The average values of the parameters in the following sections is given in Table~\ref{tab:PPC2AvgPars}.

		    	\subsubsection{Trigger efficiency}
			\label{sec:DeploymentPPC2SoudanAnalysisTriggerEfficiency}    
			
	Trigger efficiency was measured as described in Section~\ref{sec:DeploymentPPC2SoudanTriggerDesign}.  Initial tests were performed during the commissioning period (i.e.~before counting runs began) and automatic tests were run after every hour-long cycle beginning 38~days into the counting run period.  The goal of these tests was to investigate how the trigger threshold behaved over time, tracking any changes that might occur due to shifts in environmental conditions or because of other unforeseen phenomena.  To parameterize the efficiency, the data were fit to an error function, $f_{eff}(E)$, in the form:

				\begin{equation}
					f_{eff}(E) = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2} \operatorname{erf} \left( s ( E-\rho ) \right)
					\label{eqn:TriggerEfficiency}
				\end{equation}
				
with energy, $E$, in keV; scaling parameter, $s$, in keV$^{-1}$; and offset, $\rho$, in keV.  An example of a fit to this data is given in Figure~\ref{fig:PPC2TriggeringEfficiencyExample}.  Some results of the trigger tests over time are given in Figure~\ref{fig:PPC2AllPlotCompare}, comparing them to other detector parameters.  The offset parameter, $\rho$, was largely stable but increased before the transition from I$\to$II and again during region III.  $\rho$ returned to a lower value during region II.  The scaling, $s$, was largely insensitive to any change in reset rate, though exhibited slight deviations low in transitions between regions I and II.

		    	\subsubsection{Pulser data}
			\label{sec:DeploymentPPC2SoudanAnalysisPulserData}    

	Pulses from the Agilent waveform generator were input into the test input at a rate of 1~Hz and at low energy: $\sim2.5$~keV.  These events underwent analysis equivalent to every other waveform and were selected by finding all waveforms which arrived in coincidence with the pulser synchronization signal.  Each hour-long run yielded a data set of $\sim3600$ events; the calculated amplitudes (energies) of these events were histogrammed and fit to a gaussian to extract the mean, $\mu$, and the sigma, $\sigma$, of the pulser signal for each run.  Results of these fits are plotted versus run number in Figure~\ref{fig:PPC2AllPlotCompare}.  It is clear that the width of the noise ($\sigma$) did not significantly alter for reset rates below 15~Hz.  However, the mean ($\mu$) of the pulser demonstrated three clear transition regions an example of which have been labeled `I', `II', and `III' in Figure~\ref{fig:PPC2AllPlotCompare}: from reset rates 3$\to$7~Hz (region I labeled in the plot), the mean increased, transitioned to lower values for reset rates 7$\to$11~HZ (region II), and then returned for rates above 11~Hz (region III).  The absolute cause of this behavior was not determined, but it is possibly due to a modification of operating parameters of the front-end crystal electronics (e.g.~the FET) by the increasing leakage current.

	    	\subsubsection{Conclusions}
		\label{sec:DeploymentPPC2SoudanAnalysisParsTimeConclusion}    	
	
	The results of this section underscore the need to track detector parameters over time to monitor changing environmental conditions and other unanticipated behavior.  The gain and offset shifts evident in the pulser and trigger efficiency results do not significantly affect these data because their magnitudes ($<$25~eV) are much less than the nominal noise FWHM ($\sim$235~eV) and trigger threshold (90\% efficient at 1~keV) (see average values in Table~\ref{tab:PPC2AvgPars}).  However, these deviations could begin to have a larger effect with improved systems with reduced noise and threshold.  Additionally, when extracting information on physics signals in regions close to threshold (such as dark matter), it is critical to study parameters affecting this region over time to understand systematics important for limits or claims.

	    	\subsection{Cuts}
		\label{sec:DeploymentPPC2SoudanAnalysisCuts}    
			
	Cuts were introduced to clean the data with the goal of removing spurious events from, for example, noise, microphonics and reset-pulse events.  These consisted of (1) a timing cut for removing reset pulse events, and (2) a baseline cut and (3) an integrated-counts-per-run cut for removing noise and microphonics-induced events.  The first two cuts were applied on an event-by-event basis, whereas the last cut removed an entire hour-long run. 
	
			\subsubsection{Reset-pulse timing cut}
	Reset pulse waveforms had distinct qualities (positive clipping whereas energy pulses were negative-going) which allowed the waveforms to be removed online from the data stream while retaining the timing information of the event.  The offline timing cut introduced a veto window of 1~ms following a reset event.  Given the average reset rate ($\sim$10~Hz), this introduced a $\sim$1\% correction to the live-time.  

			\subsubsection{Baseline cut}	
	The baselines of the traces were monitored on an event-by-event basis by calculating a 1st-degree polynomial fit to the first 3.5~$\mu$s of each preamp trace.  From this information, an average baseline was calculated for each run to generate a cut based upon significant deviations from these average values.  In a stable system, the baseline will be gaussian distributed around a central value according to the magnitude of the noise.  The integrated-counts-per-run in particular energy windows (0.6-10~keV and 10-70~keV) were monitored as well to observe deviations from expectation assuming poisson statistics.  This second cut relied upon the fact that spurious events from increases in environmental noise and microphonics arrive in bursts, see e.g.~\cite{Morales1992410}).  
	
	The average baseline per run shifted with a systematic correlation with a shift in the measured inhibit rate, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:PPC2AllPlotCompare}.  As the leakage current increased, the inhibit rate went up and the measured baseline dropped due to additional charge collection on the AC-coupling capacitor.  In general, this downward shift in baseline could affect the dynamic (energy) range of a digitizer channel because it would allow fewer ADC values for the (negative-going) pulses before clipping.  To generate a cut on this value, the values of the baseline for each event with an energy greater than 0.4~keV during a run were histogrammed and fit to a gaussian.  (The integrated counts in this energy range for an hour-long run was $\sim$4000.)  A cut was then generated based upon the results of this fit: rejecting events outside the range $\mu\pm3\sigma$ for a 99.7\% acceptance.  An example of one of these fits is shown in~\ref{fig:PPC2BaselineCuts}.  During LN fills, the baseline would return to its maximum value making a cut based upon the average baseline value impossible.  Runs during these transition times were cut from the data set.

				\end{figure}
				
			\subsubsection{Integrated-counts-per-run cut}
	To determine the integrated-counts-per-run cut, counts in a designated energy window for each run were calculated and histogrammed.  The resulting data were then fit to a Poisson distribution and a cut was generated based upon 99.99\% acceptance using the fit distribution.  Results of this calculation are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:PPC2NoiseCuts}.  All runs with $\leq29$~counts between 0.6 and 10~keV were accepted.  
	
	All of these cuts were applied to the data to obtain a cleaned data set and all results described in the following sections use data after cuts.

					\label{fig:PPC2NoiseCuts}
				\end{figure}
	
	    	\subsection{Rise-time calculations}
		\label{sec:DeploymentPPC2SoudanAnalysisRisetime}    
	
			
	The rise-time of each pulse was calculated using a simple algorithm: 
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item Subtract the baseline, $b$, and determine the amplitude, $a$.
					\item Forward search from beginning of the waveform to determine when the waveform reaches 
					$\frac{1}{2}a$ to find the middle of the pulse, $m$.
					\item From $m$, search backwards (forwards) to determine start (end) of the rise of the waveform.  
					The start and stop of the waveform are defined when the pulse reaches 10\% and 90\% of the amplitude.
				\end{enumerate}
The rise-time versus energy is plotted for each channel in Figure~\ref{fig:PPC2RisetimeCalculations}.  The low-gain channel demonstrates a sharp intensity band centered at $\sim$0.3~$\mu$s rise-time indicating that most pulses have this fast rise-time.  A number of gamma lines at higher energy are apparent in the data, including $^{40}$K (1460.8~keV), $^{214}$Bi (1764.5~keV), and $^{208}$Tl (2614.5~keV)\footnote{The thallium line is shifted in down in energy to $\sim$2550~keV.  An explanation of this is provided in Section~\ref{sec:DeploymentPPC2SoudanAnalysisEnergySpectra}}, with rise-time greater than~$0.3~\mu$s.  Because a large portion of events in these lines are composed of Compton-scatter interactions which deposit energy at multiple sites in the detector, this suggests multi-site events are being observed as slow-rise-time events.  
	
At low energy in the high-gain channel, one does not expect to see a significant multi-site population because Compton scatters summing to such a small energy are very improbable.  However, the rise-time distribution for the high-gain channel yields some interesting results: the strong line at $0.3~\mu$s still exists and there is a distribution near threshold ($\lesssim$1~keV) where it is clear the rise-time calculation algorithm breaks down, but there is also a strong population of slow-rise-time events at low energy, $1\leq E \leq20$~keV.  Closer inspection reveals a significant visual difference between `fast' ($\sim$0.3~$\mu$s) pulses and `slow' ($>1~\mu$s) pulses as can been seen in Figure~\ref{fig:PPC2RisetimeExamplePulses}.  A similar result was found for this detector by J.~Orrell~\cite{Orr2008a}.  Since these slow-rise-time events are predominately at low energy, they can compose a background to any signal near threshold.  See Section~\ref{sec:RisetimeCuts} for discussion on improved identification and removal of these events including a discussion on their potential origins.

	    	\subsection{Energy spectra}
		\label{sec:DeploymentPPC2SoudanAnalysisEnergySpectra}    	
			
	Studies on the high-energy channel were performed by A.~Schubert to identify peaks and study the resolution of the detector with higher energy gamma lines~\cite{Schubert:2009ff}.  The spectrum was calibrated using prominent peaks in the spectra.  The resolution was fit to a second-order polynomial function of energy and determined to be:
				\begin{equation}
					\sigma = \sqrt{(0.242 \pm 0.016)^{2} +  E (4.04 \pm 0.1 \times 10^{-3})^{2} + E^{2} (9.2 \pm 0.0004 \times 10^{-4})^{2}} 
				\label{eqn:HighEnergySigma}
				\end{equation}			
with $E$, energy in keV.  It was found that the 2614.5~keV peak of the $^{208}$Tl decay was shifted down in energy to 2561~keV and had a larger-than-expected sigma (given Equation~\ref{eqn:HighEnergySigma}) of 8.6~keV.  This was explained by noting that large energy depositions in the crystal could saturate the pulse-reset preamp introducing either clipped or distorted pulses into the digitizer.  A selection of a few prominent lines fit in~\cite{Schubert:2009ff} is given in Table~\ref{tab:PPC2HighEnergyGammaLines}.  Results from this suggest that the linearity of the high-energy channel can not be trusted past the 1764~keV line of $^{214}$Bi.  This conclusion highlights a concern regarding the difficulty of using low-noise preamps with reset electronics while simultaneously looking at high-energy data $>$3-4~MeV as the \MJ~\minmod~will do.  Preamp solutions will have to address the optimization problem of ensuring enough dynamic range to search for $\nonubb$ while retaining low noise and threshold.

	\section{Estimate of \texorpdfstring{\gersixeight}{68Ge}~surface production}       
	\label{sec:Ge68ProdPPC}
	
       \gersixeight~is a cosmogenically-produced isotope inside germanium detectors which is a well-known background to $\nonubb$ (see e.g.~\cite{Ceb06aa}) due to the fact that the decays of its \galsixeight~daughters can deposit energy in the $\nonubb$ region-of-interest.  A schematic of the decay chain is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:GE68Decay}.  The decay of \gersixeight~proceeds via electron-capture with a half-life of 271~days to \galsixeight, which subsequently decays to $^{68}$Zn with a half-life of 68~minutes.  The latter decay has a Q-value of 2921~keV which could deposit energy at 2039~keV, the $\nonubb$ Q-value.  This background can be reduced two ways: (1) an analysis cut which tags the initial decay of \gersixeight~and vetoes the detector for a specified multiple of \galsixeight~half-lives, and/or (2) reduce the intrinsic \gersixeight~content in germanium detectors by either storing them in a low-cosmic-ray-flux environment (i.e.~underground) and waiting or by actively removing \gersixeight~through isotopic depletion.  Because \gersixeight~decays inside the detector, the total energy emitted through Auger electrons and x-rays is summed to lines of the K-, L-, or M-electron binding energy of the daughter nuclei (see Table~\ref{tab:GE68decayinfo}).  These lines can then be used to tag events likely to belong to a \gersixeight~decay.  Tagging the \gersixeight~decays to reduce the \galsixeight~background is dependent on the decay rate of \gersixeight, $\lambda^{(^{68}Ge)}$, and is not a viable solution until $\lambda^{(^{68}Ge)} \tau_{1/2}^{(^{68}Ga)} \ll 1$.   Estimations of the \gersixeight~activation rate at the earth's surface in both natural and enriched (86\% $^{76}$Ge) have been performed previously (see e.g.~\cite{Avi92,Elliott:2009cw,Mei2009417}).

     The \ppc2 detector provided an excellent opportunity to measure the \gersixeight~activation rate at the surface.  Though the background rate at the L-capture energy of \gersixeight~was too high to resolve any peak, the K-capture line at 10.367~keV provided a means to measure the activation rate.  At the surface, the detector was assumed to be at equilibrium: that is, the decay rate of the cosmogenic isotopes were equal to the population rates.  This was a good approximation since the detector had been kept at the surface for a period on the order of the lifetime of \gersixeight.  Once the detector is brought underground, the cosmogenic isotopes are being populated at a rate much lower than that at the surface and it is a safe to assume at the depths of Soudan ($\sim2000$~m.w.e.) that this rate is 0.  Therefore, an underground measurement of the decay rate of \gersixeight~in counts/day can be used to determine the activation rate in counts/day at the surface.  The measurement was performed beginning 7~months after the detector had been deployed underground and after \gersevenone, a short-lived cosmogenic ($\tau_{1/2}=11.4$~days) which also populates the same capture peaks, had decayed.
		
	To perform the measurement, an energy window was selected around the K-capture peak from 10$\to$10.73~keV as the ``signal'' region -- chosen as symmetric around the expected signal mean -- and from 11$\to$15 as the ``background'' region, nearby and without any x-ray lines.  The average rate, in counts/keV/kg/day, was computed for each 72~hours of live-time in both regions and fit simultaneously to the function:
	
			\begin{equation}
				f(E,t) = \left\{ 
				\begin{array}{lr} 
 					a + b e^{-\left( \log{2} \right) t/\tau_{1/2}} & 10 \leq E \leq 10.73~\textrm{(keV)}\\
					\\
					a & 11 \leq E \leq 15~\textrm{(keV)}\\
				\end{array} \right.			
			\end{equation}
with the free parameters $a$ (flat background rate), $b$ (\gersixeight~rate), and $\tau_{1/2}$ (\gersixeight~half-life).  Fit results of this are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:Ge68FitResults} and plotted in Figure~\ref{fig:GE68Production}.  At the beginning of the counting runs, the detector had already been underground 212~days, meaning that the estimated decay rate, $b$, must be multiplied by the value $e^{(\log(2)~212 d/270.95 d)} = 1.72$ as well as  the energy window (0.73~keV) to get the counts-per-day-per-kilogram the day the detector was brought underground.  It was necessary to estimate the acceptance of the energy window using parameters ($\mu$ and $\sigma$) found from a maximum likelihood fit to the data (see, e.g.~Section~\ref{sec:DeploymentPPC2SoudanAnalysisEnergySpectra}); this acceptance was measured as $0.99797\pm0.001$.  Finally, since only the K-capture line was used in this estimation, the percentage of decays into this channel must be taken into account (see Table~\ref{tab:GE68decayinfo}).  The final result was then determined to be $53.3\pm4.3$~counts/kg/day which can also be interpreted as the activation rate for \gersixeight.  A comparison of this value to previous results is given in Table~\ref{tab:Ge68PreviousResults}.  It should be noted that this detector was fabricated in Europe and then shipped via airplane to Richland, WA, USA so that additional activation would have occurred during transportation.  Therefore, the calculated activation rate of $53.3\pm4.3$~\gersixeight~atoms/kg/day should be considered conservative since the detector would not have reached equilibrium from its original shipment date until its deployment underground ($\sim1$~year).

	\section{Conclusions}
	
	A \MJ-like data acquisition system operated stably in a deployed
environment for over a half year, demonstrating software and hardware
robustness required for the \MJ~\minmod.  A tiered analysis framework was
constructed that allowed automated processing and management of data from the
deployed system.  This flexible framework was applied to data from two other
detectors, including one analyzed in Chapter~\ref{chap:AnalysisBeGe}.  Several
parameters of the data were tracked and exhibited deviations over time,
underscoring the need to monitor channel rates, electronic noise, and trigger
efficiency throughout the life of a deployed system.  Although the backgrounds
seen in the detector were too large to provide competitive limits on dark
matter signals, two important results from the data were made including a
measurement of rise-time versus energy for low-energy pulses and an estimation
of \gersixeight~surface activation in natural germanium.  The measurement of
the former determined a potential source of background for applications such as
the \MJ~\minmod~using PPCs for direct dark matter detection.  Results from this
deployment reaffirmed conclusions made in Appendix~\ref{chap:DAQDevel}, namely
that the trigger efficiency and electronic noise measured with this system were
insufficient for dark matter searches or for sensitivity to the L-capture line
of \gersixeight~and would therefore require an update in hardware for improvement.

These conclusions helped lead to the deployment of another, lower-background \ppc~with
improved triggering capabilities and the ability to measure the rise-time of 
preamplifier traces.  As well, the tools developed for the analysis of \ppc2 would
be directly applicable to the new detector.  The deployment and analysis of data
from this low-background \ppc~are the subject of Chapters~\ref{chap:AnalysisBeGe},~\ref{chap:DMWIMPLimits} and~\ref{chap:OtherPhys}.
