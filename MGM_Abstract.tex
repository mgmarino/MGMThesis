P-type point-contact (\ppc) germanium detectors present an exciting detector technology,
yielding sub-keV thresholds and intrinsically low electronic noise.  Characteristics of
the detectors enhance their background-rejection capabilities for experiments searching
for neutrinoless double-beta decay in \gersevensix~and, as such, the \MJ~experiment will 
deploy a \minmod~module with arrayed {\ppc}s.  In addition, these same
qualities make the detectors sensitive to direct dark matter detection.  The consecutive 
deployment of two \ppc~detectors underground at Soudan Underground Laboratory is presented, providing
results and conclusions about low-energy backgrounds and data-acquisition requirements at low energies. 
Data from the lower-background detector is used to generate limits on 
the spin-independent nuclear recoil of low-mass ($\lesssim10$~GeV) WIMPs as well as on 
the strength of the axion-electron coupling.  Finally, a contextual discussion
of these results is given, focusing on estimating the sensitivity of the 
\MJ~\minmod~to detect dark matter.
