Chapter 1
% An Introduction

\chapter{The Neutrino and neutrinoless double-beta decay}

**********************************

Chapter 2
% This chapter will serve as an introduction to dark-matter physics

\chapter{Dark matter}


**********************************

Chapter 3
% This chapter will focus on reductions in background at the 0nu Q-value.
% In particular, it will list advantages of using this type of geometry.
% Results from Digitizer tests (direct comparisons) will be presented here.
% Possible to do an analysis of SSTC (68Ge) cuts using CoGeNT data?

\chapter{Background reduction with point-contact p-type germanium detectors}

**********************************

Chapter 4
% In this chapter, I will describe the techniques used to characterize the BeGe detectors,
% including tests involving e.g. resolution, noise, charge collection, multi-site rejection.
%
% Results of the tests will be presented
%
% It is also possible to present some of my hardware/software development work here
% since this is relevant to the characterization studies.  I imagine these
% will occupy appendices.

\chapter{Characterization studies of BeGe Detectors}

**********************************

Chapter 5
% In this chapter, I will tabulate and explain expected backgrounds
% in the low-energy region (<50keV).  Results from estimations
% and simulations of these backgrounds will be presented.  
% Is it possible to present results from CoGeNT?  That is, 
% they will have data that will be relevant to \MJ and so 
% it would be useful to perform an analysis on this data looking
% for and establishing these backgrounds.  

\chapter{Low-Energy Backgrounds in the \MJ~Experiment}

**********************************

Chapter 6
% In this chapter, I will perform calculations to determine
% sensitivity of Majorana, given the backgrounds discussed
% in the previous chapter, to dark matter and low-energy
% physics.  A number of different models of dark matter will be covered

\chapter{Sensitivity of \MJ~to low-energy physics}

**********************************

Appendix A
% Here, focus on the development of MGDO (waveform processing
% framework, data objects), OrcaROOT, and other tools 

\chapter{Waveform processing toolkit for \MJ}

**********************************

Appendix B
% Discuss some of the hardware-related work done
% Touch on development of the Gretina card, SBC,
% ORCA, etc.

\chapter{Development of Digitizer Hardware for \MJ}
